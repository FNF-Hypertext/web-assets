## Friday Night Funkin assets compiled for the web

These are the assets generated by `lime build html5`. It's mostly the same as the desktop assets, but it has MP3 audio. Idk The Differences Actually!!!

Theres also tags you can `git checkout` to to see any version up to v0.6.0

This is used as a submodule in FNF Hypertext Engine, meaning its ready to go and doesn't need any setup!!
